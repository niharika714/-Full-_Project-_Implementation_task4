This repository contains the HTML, CSS (styled with Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript code for an interactive Project Dashboard. It features a fixed sidebar for navigation between a personal portfolio section (with "About," "Projects," and "Contact" sub-sections), a functional To-Do List application with local storage persistence, and a dynamic Product Listing page with filtering and sorting capabilities. The dashboard is designed to be a user-friendly interface showcasing web development skills through practical implementations of common web application features.
